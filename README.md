### Project Overview:
This project is a **To-Do List Application** that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. It features the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks, with tasks being saved in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring that they persist across page reloads. The application is designed to be simple yet functional, providing a user-friendly interface for task management.

### Objective:
The objective of this To-Do list is to help users organize their tasks effectively, track progress, and stay organized. The app allows users to add new tasks, modify existing tasks, and remove completed ones. It also makes use of local storage for task persistence, ensuring the list is saved even after the browser is closed.

### Key Activities:
1. **Task Management**:
   - Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete tasks when done.
   - Tasks are saved in local storage for persistence.
2. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Created a minimalist interface with a dark theme for better readability and a modern aesthetic.
   - Tasks are displayed with interactive elements such as edit and delete buttons.
3. **Interactivity**:
   - Enabled task editing and deletion with interactive buttons.
   - Used JavaScript for real-time interaction like editing and saving tasks.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the page and displaying the to-do list.
- **CSS**: For styling the app with a responsive, dark-themed layout, and modern UI components.
- **JavaScript**: For managing the interactive elements, handling events (like adding, editing, and deleting tasks), and storing the tasks in local storage.

### Features:
- **Task List**: Display tasks dynamically, and interact with them (edit or delete).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage so the list is retained across sessions.
- **Date Display**: The current date is displayed at the top of the page for context.

This app offers a clean, user-friendly way to keep track of daily tasks, making it useful for anyone who needs a simple task management tool.
